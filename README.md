# mario-gen
fixed version of "mackstann/markovio"

# how to set up
download and install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ then extract the mario-gen zip into a folder then run markovio.py using python and it should generate an xpm file, view it from https://jumpshare.com/viewer/xpm or if you have an app that does that for you

# probably adding more updates soon uhh yeah
